      All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
      and why you too should learn it.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>What is HTML?</strong></h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web
      developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a
      programming language).
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <p>
      The opening tag
      <br />
      The closing tag
      <br />
      The actual element <br />
      You can learn more at the MDN Web Docs.
    </p>
    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
      web. Here are 5 of them:
    </p>
    <p>
      To be able to use the fundamental web dev language <br />
      To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress
      or Wix <br />
      To build web applications <br />
      To impress friends <br />
      To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ
    </p>
    <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
